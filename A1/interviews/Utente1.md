**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So, the first question is: tell me about your most recent mobility abroad. Where did you go and for how much time? We are talking about a relative long period you stayed abroad.

**Utente1:** So we are not talking about work, right? Okay. I went for one week to South Korea for a conference in November 2025\.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. I get that you probably explored a bit other than work. Think about your exploration of the areas of the city. Were you alone or were you with someone, and how did you choose where to go?

**Utente1:** I was mostly alone. Sometimes I met people, but not really to discover the city. How I chose where to go? I looked up a few YouTube videos that were touristic guides, mostly about where to eat. Then I looked at some Reddit posts about the most essential stuff to see in South Korea in 4 days, because I was working three days going there. So then I just planned my days being like: "Okay, all the restaurants that I want to try are around there and I want to visit this, so I have half a day to do this and that." I planned my days combining the restaurants I wanted to go to and the touristic sites I wanted to visit, using YouTube and Reddit.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So, when you are looking for an authentic place in a city—and this is a general question, not strictly related to Korea—what do you usually do?

**Utente1:** I ask people that have been raised there. For example, I texted Yuna, a colleague of mine that was born and raised in South Korea and studied there up until her master's degree. I asked her what she could recommend. Then I cross-referenced it with what I could find on YouTube. But for other places, if I'm capable of talking to someone from that place, I will definitely ask them for more personalized references that they care about. Not just touristic places, but authentic ones, really the heart of the place.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. Can you tell me about the last time you chose a place based on a local's recommendation? How did it go compared to your expectation?

**Utente1:** That's a bit harsh because I had global expectations about the place and everything let me down a bit. So her recommendation also let me down a bit, but not more than the ones I found myself. She didn't suggest any restaurants, so there is nothing to say about this. For the place she suggested, going to the tower, that was actually a nice hike. That was okay, but that's also one of the most touristic things to do. So she didn't really give me something authentic per se.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So I get that you would have liked to have a more authentic suggestion by a local.

**Utente1:** No, I don't think that. I think she thought her recommendations were touristic and authentic. The things that get recommended are the things that work for tourism, and that's okay. She didn't have any particular cozy spot in mind, and it's quite a big city.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. Perfect. And in general, what are your main interests for social events? Like hanging out, going to a party, a day out, a night out, whatever.

**Utente1:** My main interest is to share something with them. So either being able to have long and interesting conversations or being able to share a movie, a theater, or something like this that we can talk about later. I'm not in the mood of just banging my head on some techno music. I really like sharing and being able to have deep conversations.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So, how do you feel when you need to interact with a group of people that you don't know?

**Utente1:** It depends and it evolved with time. As a kid, going to a group of young adults was a bit intimidating. Nowadays, now that I'm nearly 27, it depends on the reason why I have to approach this group of people. If I know that I don't want to go towards them, I'm not even going to feel intimidated, I'm just not going to do it because I can own my feelings. If I need to go talk to them, I'll just go and find some icebreaker in the room. I guess the idea is: do I have something to break the ice? Assuming they're already talking about something, how can I get in? Maybe making a joke, maybe bouncing on something they just said and adding information. That's a balance and depends on the context. If it's at a conference, it's going to be a bit harder to just go and have a laugh with them; it's going to be way more professional and I'm going to have to find an angle that can raise their curiosity. Whereas if it's at a party, I'm just going to try to find something in common with maybe one person I know in the group and try to integrate.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay, good. Next question: have you ever visited a place or participated in an event that didn't really interest you just because of some good recommendation you got?

**Utente1:** I'm trying to dig in my memories... Yes. In South Korea, a group of other fellow PhD students wanted to go to a karaoke evening. I was more in the mood of visiting the place. They were pressuring me a bit because they wanted to have enough people to do the karaoke. I wasn't really interested in those people, I didn't really like them. But I was like, "Okay, let's try to see how it is to have a party in Seoul." So I tried, and it went the way it went. It wasn't really interesting. I wasn't happy about going instead of refusing it, but I wasn't devastated either.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. And do you remember the last time you turned down an event or hang out because of the cost of it?

**Utente1:** Yeah. The following day after the karaoke, they wanted to do something else and I just lied. I was like "I can't, I'm elsewhere, I can't go there, you guys have fun without me." They proved to me that I wasn't going to miss out on anything the day before, so I didn't go.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So, now we switch a bit and we're going to consider you as a local. Think about the city you live in. Has it ever happened to you that a foreigner asked you for recommendations about places or events? What did you recommend and why specifically that place?

**Utente1:** Yes, let's say my partner's family, more precisely my sister-in-law. She wanted to know what she could do in a few days in Paris. I mostly directed her towards the Japanese neighborhood in Paris because I know it's something she cares about and that's very unique to Paris to have a neighborhood like this. It has restaurants and bookshops with Japanese books. I tried to make something very tailored for her needs and wishes. First of all, I've never been to the top of the Eiffel Tower, and I know you need to pay the cost and it's not that interesting. So I would more likely advise her to go to some museum that I really enjoyed that has nice decorations, like the Musée d'Orsay. Otherwise, I'm also suggesting gardens like the Luxembourg one, because they're nice when you like to hike a bit—or at least walk around. There are some nice things to do around Luxembourg, like the Latin Quarter, the Pantheon, and all the big schools. Since I'm also going with her, I'm able to be a bit of a visitor guide somehow. I can add a bit of personal information about the places because my high school and university were there. It's always a bit nicer when I can share a bit of my story within the place.

**Denise Nanni:** And how was her reaction to this tailored experience?

**Utente1:** She really loved what was tailored for her. Regarding what was more on my side—everything about my personal life—she was interested and happy to do it, but she wasn't passionate about it. She wasn't disappointed either. She only has a few days staying in Paris before going back to Bologna. But it was nice. She often wants to go back to the Japanese neighborhood, so she has a favorite place, but she still enjoys my recommendations.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. So, what things make you understand that a place or an event is attended mostly by locals?

**Utente1:** If I'm being funny, I'd say that if it's something that is not on TikTok, then it's quite okay. If I'm being realistic, it's because I heard other locals mentioning it. I know it because it's in our common knowledge. If I've never heard of something, or I know it's known because it's on social media, I'm like, "Okay, it's going to be kind of touristic, crowded, not really interesting, or too expensive." Whereas we know places because we grew up here and we've seen them even without going there. We hear of it because we talk. So when it's in the common knowledge of other locals, I trust them. It's a name that comes back and forth growing up in the place.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. Tell me about your last three days or nights out. Where did you go and with who?

**Utente1:** One of them was a hot pot. A colleague of mine suggested going to a Chinese hot pot, which is food she is used to having when she was in China. She wanted to share it with us, to have a very nice and warm meal shared with a lot of people. We were like 17 colleagues and we went there, and that was very nice. She knew the place because of some Chinese group messages; she has her own personalized recommendations validated by some Chinese community in Paris that share addresses. Other than this, I had my partner's friend coming over for the weekend. They went out the whole weekend and I tagged along in the evening to have dinner with them at a restaurant called Tranai near Montparnasse in the 14th. We chose this place because it's one of the favorite places of my partner and she wanted to make her friend try it. Even though it's not French food—it's Su food, Chinese food—we all really liked it. My partner and I are used to it, we know it well, but our friend really liked it as well.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay. Interesting. Guys, do you want to go on with the last questions or...? Because I think we can actually stop here.

**Utente1:** Okay.

**Denise Nanni:** Okay, thank you so much for your help. It was really useful. It was actually what I expected to get. So I think that we will show you the results of our work.

**Utente1:** Good. Sure. Take your time. You want to defend in 2027, you can. It's fine. Just have to pay taxes, right? No big deal.
