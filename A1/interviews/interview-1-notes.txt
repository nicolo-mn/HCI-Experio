Went to South Korea for a conference. Was mostly alone, viewed touristic guides on YT. Asks locals to explore some players for personalized advice, authentic places. Last suggestion he got was a restaurant and a nice hike. Looks forward to share something with people he goes out with, some experience like theather, a movie, having deep conversation etc. Interaction with groups of people were harder in the past, it's fine for him not to interact with groups of people if they're intimidating. It's easier to interact with a group of people to break the ice. Went to a party with other PhD students, but didn't feel like it. Recommendation as a local to his partner's family about Paris, tried to advice her some places he liked and make the experience personalized for them. He recognizes places that are not touristic because they are not on social media, and by other people experiences he knows. Last times he went out: hotpot with colleagues, went out with his partner.
